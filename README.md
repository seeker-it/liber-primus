# Liber Primus - Comprehensive Analysis and Solving Attempts

## Overview
This repository is my dedicated effort to document the knowledge, analysis, and solving attempts of *Liber Primus*, the cryptographic book that emerged as part of the *Cicada 3301* puzzle series. It is structured to provide historical context, linguistic analysis, cryptographic techniques, and documented efforts to decipher its contents. 

## Introduction

<details>
  <summary>Background || What Is Cicada?</summary> <br>
**Cicada 3301** is an enigmatic organization that first appeared online in 2012, posting a cryptic message on forums such as 4chan. The message invited individuals to solve a series of puzzles, suggesting that they were seeking highly intelligent individuals. Over time, Cicada 3301 gained a reputation as one of the most sophisticated and mysterious internet puzzles, incorporating elements from cryptography, steganography, classical literature, philosophy, and various coding techniques. While no group has ever definitively claimed responsibility for Cicada 3301, speculation abounds, with theories ranging from it being a recruitment tool for intelligence agencies to an independent secret society aiming to promote privacy, cryptography, and free information.

  <summary>Background || 2012 & 2013</summary>
<h2>2012</h2>

On **January 4, 2012**, an image appeared on 4chan’s /x/ board, containing white text on a black background. The text read:

> *"Hello. We are looking for highly intelligent individuals. To find them, we have devised a test. There is a message hidden in this image. Find it, and it will lead you on the road to finding us. We look forward to meeting the few that will make it all the way through. Good luck. 3301"*

This was the first public introduction to Cicada 3301. While it seemed like a random message, cryptography enthusiasts immediately began investigating, suspecting that there was hidden information in the image. Using steganographic techniques and software such as outguess, they found that the image contained hidden data embedded within its pixels, which led to a Caesar cipher-encoded message. The message, once decoded, pointed to a URL on the internet. This marked the beginning of a multi-step journey that would take solvers through various disciplines of cryptography, history, and philosophy.

<h2>2013</h2>

On **January 4, 2013**, an image appeared on 4chan’s /x/ board again, containing white text on a black background. The text read:

> *"Hello again. Our search for intelligent individuals now continues. The first clue is hidden within this image. Find it, and it will lead you on the road to finding us. We look forward to meeting the few that will make it all the way through. Good luck. 3301"*
